    "Neovim is a refactor - and sometimes redactor - in the tradition"
    "of Vim, which itself derives from Stevie. It is not a rewrite,"
    "but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many rewrites, clones,"
    "emulators and imitators exist; some are very clever, but none are"
    "Vim. Neovim strives to be a superset of Vim, notwithstanding some"
    "intentionally removed misfeatures; excepting those few and"
    "carefully-considered excisions, Neovim is Vim. It is built for"
    "users who want the good parts of Vim, without compromise, and"
    "more."
